## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## L5 Swagger - OpenApi or Swagger Specification for your Laravel project made easy.
==========

This package automatically generates Swagger documentation for your Laravel API based on your annotations.

## Here are the steps to integrate l5-swagger into your Laravel project:

## Install the package using Composer:

composer require darkaonline/l5-swagger
After the installation is complete, publish the configuration file:

php artisan vendor:publish --provider "L5Swagger\L5SwaggerServiceProvider"
Open the generated configuration file located at config/l5-swagger.php and make sure the generate_always option is set to true:

- `'generate_always' => env('L5_SWAGGER_GENERATE_ALWAYS', true),`

## Generate the Swagger documentation:

        php artisan l5-swagger:generate


## Please visit [L5 Swagger Wiki](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/wiki) for more information:
- [Installation & Configuration](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/wiki/Installation-&-Configuration)
- [Change Log](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/wiki/Change-Log)
- [Migration Guides](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/wiki/Migration-Guides)
- [Using Swagger UI with Passport](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/wiki/Using-Swagger-UI-with-Passport)
- [Tips](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger/wiki/Tips)


### Disclaimer
This package is a wrapper of [Swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php) and [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) adapted to work with Laravel.
The actual Swagger spec is beyond the scope of this package. All L5-Swagger does is package up swagger-php and swagger-ui in a Laravel-friendly fashion, and tries to make it easy to serve. For info on how to use swagger-php [look here](https://zircote.github.io/swagger-php/). For good examples of swagger-php in action [look here](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php/tree/master/Examples/petstore.swagger.io).
